        <ins>My History &amp; Profile</ins>
    </h2>
    <p>I'm a 20 year old software engineer and web developer working in Epam Systems. I thing the most important quality
        for every engineer is skill to find the most efficient solution for the most sophisticated puzzle, and I thing I
        have this one. I have been coding websites ever since high school in my first web design class.</p>
    <p>During the education in BSU I had been studying on the Military faculty of BSU and after two years had
        successfully graduated with officer rank. Also have finished the English Courses on Intermediate level. After
        graduating High School in summer 2009 I started writing on various web design blogs along with launching my own
        startup ideas. A few months later in September 2009 I spent a couple months studying at <a
                href="http://www.wpi.edu/">Worcester Polytechnic Institute</a> in Worcester, Massachsuetts. However I
        left in January 2010 to pursue a career on my own. I now work doing freelance writing and building side-projects
        in my spare time.</p>
